## ❓ Common Questions

**Q: How does the SOS encoding work?**
A: The AI generates an innocent-looking social media post. In a real system, steganography would hide your actual message in the image. This demo simulates that process.

**Q: Can others see my real message?**
A: In this demo, the post looks innocent to everyone. Only authorities with decoding tools could extract the hidden SOS (in a real implementation).

**Q: How do I update my case?**
A: View your dashboard to see current status. Authorities can update status from their end.

**Q: Is the AI real?**
A: The responses are simulated for this demo. A production system would use actual AI models.

**Q: Can I create multiple cases?**
A: Yes! Click "Create SOS Post" again to submit a new case.

**Q: How do I delete my data?**
A: Clear your browser's local storage to delete all cases.
